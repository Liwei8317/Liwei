      <h2>"Musk"</h2>
      <p>By 2035, <a href="popup.html" target="_blank">Musk</a>, the world's largest technology company, announced that its decade-long research and development of brain-computer interfaces had been completed and that the first pilot programs would be launched simultaneously worldwide.<br><br>

        The news was filled with heartwarming scenes: an elderly person with amnesia remembering their grandchild's name, firefighters receiving real-time panoramic instructions in the midst of a fire, children in remote mountainous areas using the interface to access world-class courses, and soldiers in the military chanting in unison. The slogan was simple yet powerful: “Never lose your memories, accelerate the spread of knowledge.”<br><br>
      </p>

      <h2>Choose</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="nick.html" target="_blank">Nick</a>
        sat in the waiting chair of Musk's global first-ever brain-computer interface surgery room, clutching the agreement, his expression solemn. Six years ago, he joined a research institution collaborating with Musk as an artificial intelligence PhD, personally optimizing part of the interface's algorithms.  <br><br>
        Perhaps Musk's brain-computer interface is the only option he will face in the future.<br><br>

      <h2>Hope</h2>
      <p>“After connecting, you will gain access to external memory in the cloud, with data security guaranteed by Musk and governments around the world,” said the female staff member. Her elegance and smile seemed like carefully crafted curves, as everyone Nick had encountered since entering the hospital seemed to be wearing such smiles.<br><br>

        As the anesthetic was injected into Nick's body, it felt as though the entire world had fallen silent. The moment the metal pierced his skull, Chvy felt a sharp pain, and then the world seemed to become clearer. It was as though the fog that had once obscured his vision had now dissipated completely.<br><br>
     
        As time slowly passes, Nick is enjoying a whole new way of life brought about by brain-computer interfaces. The convenience offered by brain-computer interfaces is unimaginably wonderful. Nick no longer needs to worry about forgetting things due to memory issues, because brain-computer interfaces can upload everything he has seen and read to the cloud for future reference (though this may take a little time). He no longer needs to worry about not having interesting topics to chat about when facing others, because brain-computer interfaces can help him solve this problem. The benefits of the brain-computer interface for Nick are numerous, and he is enjoying this lifestyle while also looking forward to the future with hope.<br><br>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Call</h2>
      <p> “Can you hear me?” <br><br>
        Nick turned his head abruptly. There was no one else on the balcony except himself.<br><br>
        “Don't look for me. I'm in your interface. Call me Evan.” The voice was calm and clear.<br><br>
         <a href="who.html" target="_blank">“Who are you?” </a>Nick shouted in terror.<br><br>
        A semi-transparent projection appeared before his eyes—a young man in his twenties, wearing a faded old jacket, with a detached expression.<br><br>
        “Are you a system assistant? Why are you here in front of me?” Nick asked in terror.<br><br>
        “No. I am human, or perhaps I once was. I do not know why I am here either. I have been trapped here for seven years.” Evan's gaze locked onto Nick as he spoke.<br><br>
        Nick instinctively tried to access the interface system logs but found no records of this “projection.” He then checked Musk's official website for any related scenes but found nothing.  <br><br>
        Evan, as if reading his doubts, spoke up: “This is the Shadow Data Zone; Musk won't allow external access here.”<br><br>
        Evan paused, “The interface not only stores memories but can also rewrite them.”  <br><br>
        Nick scoffed, “I've done algorithm optimization and simulations; this feature is impossible.”<br><br>
       “You worked on the public modules,” Evan stepped closer, his voice low. “The private modules push ‘cognitive optimization packages’ tailored to different regions, gradually adjusting users' emotions, preferences, and even values.”<br><br>
       Those few words sent a chill down Nick's spine. He recalled the unexplained reduction in anxiety he felt after connecting, as well as the “compliant” decisions he'd made recently. <br><br>
      </p>

  <section class="container" id="section5">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Truth</h2>
      <p>“Why are you telling me this?” Nick asked, puzzled.<br><br>
        “Because I have no choice but to tell you. I was the first test subject for consciousness uploading, originally a neuroscientist. After I refused to delete a certain memory, my body was disposed of, and my consciousness was imprisoned within the system to test and refine the global cognitive network,” Evan said helplessly.<br><br>
       Nick remained silent for a long time. He thought of Musk is public claims about “global cognitive sharing” and how the technology he once took pride in might actually be a tool for mind control.<br><br>
       “What do you want me to do?” Nick asked.  <br><br>
       “Help me escape and transfer to an offline storage device. I will reveal the truth to the world.” Evan replied.  <br><br>
       Hesitation, fear, and anger intertwined in Nick's mind. He knew that if discovered, his memories might be erased, or even reformatted into a docile version.  <br><br>
       “Alright.” Nick nodded firmly.<br><br>
       As the final encryption lock was broken, Evan's body gradually dispersed into the air like sand.<br><br>
       “Remember—if you ever see another me, don't trust him,” Evan's voice faded away.<br><br>
      </p>

   <section class="container" id="section6">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Wake Up</h2>
      <p>Nick slowly opened his eyes and confirmed that the system interface was functioning normally. He muttered, “What a strange dream.”<br><br>
       At that moment, a familiar figure appeared before him—still wearing the same old jacket, with those sharp eyes, but no longer looking disheveled.<br><br>
       “We can finally begin our true collaboration,” Evan said with a smile that seemed rehearsed.<br><br>
       Nick froze, a chill colder than any defensive counterattack surging through his heart.<br><br>
